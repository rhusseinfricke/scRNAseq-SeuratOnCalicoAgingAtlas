In this study the authors characterise a substanitally large amount of C. elegans cell types isolated from aging worm samples.
The data in this study identifies CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC changes in gene expression in aging worms. 
The significance of this work is that the changes in gene expression could mean that the aging cells are activating mechanisms that increase cellular resilience through proteostasis, repair and other mechanisms.
While the discovery of aging-related genes in C. elegans has facilitated discovery of conserved aging cell regulators, genome-wide analysis has been limited to whole animal studies. As a consequence, there is a dearth of longevity data at the cellular level and in turn in the various tissue of multicellular organisms.
